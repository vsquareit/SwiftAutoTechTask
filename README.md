**Tester Observation:**
There is no accessebility locator for lap row, hence test step "VerifyLapsDisplay" has been partially done.  In practise I will work with developers to get this accessebility locator added with which I can get the full text from the row and verify lap time as well.

With regards to e2e tests, I have added BDD style approach and wantedly split each and each into scenario individual as to show the scope of the project if it's a large application.

###### The below is from the original stopwatch app from Github

Stopwatch is a Swift App that measures amount of time elapsed from a particular time. It highly mocks the stopwatch of Apple's offical App called Clock. This app supports functions such as lap record, time resume, and stopwatch reset.
